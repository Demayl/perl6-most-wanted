perl6-most-wanted
=================

It's generally agreed that to kickstart active use of Perl 6 for a broad range
of tasks, we need to provide a "distro" release that includes modules covering
many common needs not met by the standard Perl 6 setting.  For a while now
this effort has been led by Rakudo Star, but (as of early 2013) it is far from
complete; too incomplete in fact to be useful for any but early adopters.

To make a distro release useful for "early majority" users, the existing
modules need to be filled out (documentation, better error handling, etc.), and
many more modules need to be created (or ported from Perl 5) to fill existing
gaps.  This repo's goal is a gap analysis: a listing of what we have, what we
need, and what's blocking module authors from filling all the gaps.
