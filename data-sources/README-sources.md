In order to figure out what we're missing, the first step is to determine
what is expected or needed.  To do this, I've collected the following sources:

* The Perl 6 setting (for determining what *doesn't* need to be a module)
* The Perl 6 Modules Directory (http://modules.perl6.org/)
* The Perl 6 Ecosystem Most Wanted Modules (https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/wiki/Most-Wanted-Modules)
* The Perl 5 bundled modules (http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git)
* The CPAN Top 100: Volatile 100 (http://ali.as/top100/)
* (WIP) Perl 5 modules packaged by multiple Linux distros and/or Strawberry Perl
  + In particular, modules in Strawberry or ActivePerl that aren't in Core (au++)
* Task::BeLike::*
  + DAGOLDEN
  + DOY, FLORA (AKA rafl), RJBS, SARTAK (sorear++)
* Requests from module and app authors
* Dog food: modules, tools, and apps we use
